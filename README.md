**ðŸ§ª Experiment 2: Data Types in C++
**
**âœ… Aim:**

To write a C++ program that demonstrates the declaration, initialization, and usage of basic built-in data types such as int, float, double, char, and bool.

**ðŸ§  Theory:**

In C++, data types specify the kind of data a variable can hold and how much memory it occupies. C++ is a statically typed language, meaning every variable must be declared with a data type before use. This allows the compiler to allocate the correct amount of memory and prevent invalid operations.

There are three main categories of data types in C++:

Primitive (Built-in) Data Types â€“ int, float, double, char, bool

Derived Data Types â€“ arrays, pointers, functions

User-defined Data Types â€“ structures, classes, unions

In this experiment, we focus only on primitive data types, which are the foundation of all C++ programs.

Description of Basic Data Types:

int â€“ Used for storing whole numbers. (e.g., age = 20)

float â€“ Stores decimal values with single precision. (e.g., height = 5.8f)

double â€“ Stores decimal values with double precision. (e.g., price = 99.99)

char â€“ Stores a single character. (e.g., grade = 'A')

bool â€“ Stores either true or false. (e.g., isActive = true)

Each data type is used for specific purposes based on the nature of data and memory requirements.

**ðŸ“˜ Conclusion:**

In this experiment, we understood how to declare and use basic data types in C++. We also learned how different types store and display values, and how they are essential for building correct and efficient programs.
