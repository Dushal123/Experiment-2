âœ… Aim:
To write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of basic data types such as int, float, double, char, and bool, and to understand how to declare, initialize, and display values using these data types.

ðŸ§  Theory:
In C++, data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold. Every variable must be declared with a specific data type so that the compiler knows how much memory to allocate and what operations are allowed on that variable.

The five most commonly used primitive data types in C++ are:

int (Integer): Used to store whole numbers without any decimal point. Example: age, count, number of items, etc.

float: Used to store numbers that include a fractional part with single precision. Useful for measurements or percentages where limited precision is acceptable.

double: Similar to float but provides double the precision. It is useful in calculations that require higher accuracy.

char (Character): Stores a single character, such as a letter or symbol. Characters are enclosed in single quotes like 'A', 'Z', or '@'.

bool (Boolean): Stores logical values: either true or false. In C++, true is represented as 1 and false as 0 when printed.

This program declares variables of all these types, assigns values to them, and then prints the values using the output stream cout. This helps in understanding how different types of data are stored and displayed in C++.

ðŸ“Œ Learning Outcomes:
Understanding the role and declaration of different basic data types in C++.

Learning how to assign and output values of different types.

Gaining knowledge about how C++ handles numeric, character, and logical data.

ðŸ”š Conclusion:
This program provides a clear understanding of how to use different primitive data types in C++. It is essential for beginners to know how to work with various types of variables before moving on to more complex programming concepts. Mastering data types forms the basis for handling inputs, calculations, and decision-making in any C++ program.
